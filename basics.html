            <h2>Solar Energy Basics</h2>
            <p>Solar energy is the radiant light and heat from the Sun that is harnessed using a range of technologies, including solar panels, to generate electricity or heat water for various applications. Here are some key concepts to understand about solar energy:</p>
            <h3>1. Solar Panels</h3>
            <p>Solar panels, also known as photovoltaic (PV) panels, are devices that convert sunlight into electricity. They are made up of many solar cells that are connected together to form a panel. When sunlight hits the solar cells, it creates an electric field that generates direct current (DC) electricity.</p>
            <h3>2. Solar Power Systems</h3>
            <p>A solar power system typically consists of solar panels, inverters, mounting structures, and sometimes batteries for energy storage. The solar panels collect sunlight and convert it into electricity, which is then converted from DC to alternating current (AC) by the inverters for use in homes or businesses.</p>
            <h3>3. Net Metering</h3>
            <p>Net metering is a billing arrangement that allows solar energy system owners to receive credit for the excess electricity they generate and send back to the grid. This helps offset the cost of electricity drawn from the grid during times when solar production is insufficient, such as at night or on cloudy days.</p>
            <h3>4. Solar Energy Advantages</h3>
            <p>There are several advantages to using solar energy, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Renewable and Sustainable: Solar energy is abundant and renewable, making it a sustainable source of power.</li>
                <li>Reduced Electricity Bills: By generating your own electricity from solar panels, you can reduce or even eliminate your electricity bills.</li>
                <li>Low Environmental Impact: Solar energy production has minimal environmental impact compared to traditional fossil fuel-based power generation.</li>
                <li>Energy Independence: Solar energy can provide a degree of energy independence by reducing reliance on grid electricity.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>5. Solar Energy Applications</h3>
            <p>Solar energy can be used for a wide range of applications, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Residential Electricity Generation</li>
                <li>Commercial and Industrial Power Generation</li>
                <li>Water Heating</li>
                <li>Solar Cooking</li>
                <li>Remote Power Systems</li>
                <li>Solar Lighting</li>
            </ul>
